## Terms

**Computer security** → the freedom from theft of or damage to hardware, software, or information, and from disruption or misdirection of services.

**Protection** → the set of mechanisms and policies that guarantee computer security, including the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and authenticity of all data and services.

A logic bomb → unauthorized code inserted into the system and executed at a specified time to perform some destructive action. The main use of a logic bomb is for blackmail or an act of revenge. 

A back door (trapdoor) → a mechanism that bypasses user authentication. Ex: A systems programmer could modify the login utility to accept a specific user without requiring a password, thus permitting unauthorized access to the system at a later time. 

Information leaking → the disclosure of confidential or secret information by a legitimate user to an unauthorized user. Ex: A user with a high security clearance could down-protect a sensitive file to make the information readable by users without security clearance.

Login spoofing → an approach where a legitimate user presents a fake login screen to an unsuspecting user, who unwittingly supplies a valid login name and password to the imposter program. A possible solution to prevent login spoofing is to display the login screen only after the user has typed in a special character sequence that automatically invokes the OS and which a user program cannot intercept (Ex: CTRL-ALT-DEL).

A Trojan horse → a program that appears to provide a useful service but also contains a hidden function intended to violate computer security.

A virus → a piece of executable code that embeds itself into legitimate programs and copies itself to other programs and systems with the intention of causing harm.

A buffer overflow attack → an intrusion technique that exploits the fact that many programs do not check for array overflow, allowing an attacker to overwrite portions of memory beyond the legitimate scope of an input buffer.

A worm → an unauthorized program, which exploits one or more systems weaknesses to spawn copies of itself on other systems via computer networks.

A sandbox → a small area of memory within which a program may execute and which guarantees that the program cannot access and jump to any location outside of the designated area
