| Fingerprint analysis  | Uses the patterns of ridges and furrows on the fingertips.                                                            | high     | medium | medium      |
| Face recognition      | Uses the relative location and shape of the eyes, nose, mouth, and other specific features common to everyone's face. | medium   | medium | high        |
| Hand geometry         | Uses the relative lengths of individual fingers and the length and width of the hand.                                 | medium   | low    | high        |
| Retina scan           | Uses the pattern of the blood vessels at the back of the eye.                                                         | high     | high   | low         |
| Iris scan             | Uses the unique patterns within the ring-shaped region surrounding the pupil of the eye.                              | high     | high   | medium      |
| Signature recognition | Uses the speed of writing and the pressure applied to the pen when producing a signature.                             | low      | medium | high        |
| Voice analysis        | Uses the frequencies and amplitudes produced during normal speech.                                                    | low      | medium | high        |

## Terms

**User authentication** → The act of verifying the identity of a person who wishes to connect to a computer or a network.

User authentication can be based on:
>>>
The knowledge of some information (ex: password)
The passion go some item (ex: smart card)
A physical characteristic or behavior of the person (ex: a fingerprint or a signature)

A **one-time password** → Can only be used once and thus becomes useless when stolen.

A **one-way hash function**. → Converts a variable-length input string into a fixed-length output string in a manner that cannot be inverted.

**Challenge-response** → A method of user authentication that has the form of a dialogue between the user and the system.

**Biometrics** → User authentication methods that measure, record, and analyze unique physical or behavioral characteristics of a person.
