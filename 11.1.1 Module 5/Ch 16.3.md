## Terms
**Copy-on-write** → Works by allowing the parent and child processes initially to share the same pages.
Generally, the practice by which any write causes the data to first be copied and then modified, rather than overwritten. In virtual memory, on a write attempt to a shared page, the page is first copied, and the write is made to that copy

**Cirtual memory fork** → The vfork() system call, which forks a child process, suspends the parent, and lets the child share the parent's address space for both read and write operations (changes are visible to the parent).
