## Terms

**Protection domain** → A set of pairs <object, rights>, where rights specify what operations a process may perform on the object.
Ex: <file1, rx> means that file1 may be read or executed but not modified.

**access matrix** → a representation of protection domains, where each row corresponds to one domain Di, each column corresponds to one object Oi, and the intersection of the row and the column records the rights that a process in domain Di has with respect to the object Oi).

==Who can== ==**destroy**== ==an object in an access matrix== → only the owner of the object

==what is== ==**c**== ==or== ^* ==in an access matrix== → it can give rights to other domains

An **access list** (**AL**) → an object O contains entries of the form (D, rights), where rights specify what operations a process in domain D may apply to object O.

A **capability list** (**CL**) → a domain D contents entries of the form (O, rights), where rights specify what operations a process in domain D may apply to object O.
