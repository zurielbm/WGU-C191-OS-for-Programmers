# Terms

A device controller (device adapter) → an electronic circuit capable of operating a specific I/O device using binary signals.

A device driver → a device-specific program that implements I/O operations, requested by user applications or the OS, by interacting with the device controller.

Programmed I/O → a style of I/O programming where the CPU, running the device driver, performs the copying of all data between the I/O device controller and main memory.

Polling → a technique to determine whether a device is busy or idle by reading a flag set and reset by the device controller.

A direct memory access (DMA) controller → a hardware component that allows devices to access main memory directly, without the involvement of the CPU.
