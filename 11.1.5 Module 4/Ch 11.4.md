# Terms

A parity bit → a bit added to a string of bits to ensure that the total number of 1's in the string is even or odd.

An error correcting code (ECC) → includes multiple parity bits in a string to permit the detection and automatic correction of some number of erroneous bits.

A bad block (bad sector) → a storage block that is no longer reliable for storing and retrieving data due to physical damage.

Sector forwarding → a technique where a bad disk block b[i] is mapped to one of the spare sectors.

Sector slipping → a technique where all blocks following a bad block b[i] are shifted to the right.

The last block → mapped to a spare sector and b[i] is mapped to the sector occupied previously by block b[i+1].

Stable storage → an approach to data management that uses redundancy, along with a strict protocol for reading, writing, and error recovery, to guarantee that all data remains consistent in the presence of media and crash failures.

A stable read → guarantees to return a valid copy of any block.

A stable write → guarantees that every block is updated atomically.

Striping → a technique where a sequence of data blocks, b[i], is distributed over n disks, such that disk[i] contains block b[i] modulo n.

A RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) → a set of disks viewed by the OS as a single mass storage device.
