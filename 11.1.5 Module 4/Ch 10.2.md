# Terms

A file directory (or folder) → a special-purpose file that records information about other files and possibly other directories.

A tree-structured directory hierarchy → a collection of directories organized such that (1) every directory points to zero or more files or directories at the next lower level, and (2) every file and directory except the root is pointed to by exactly one parent directory at the next higher level.

The root of a tree-structured directory hierarchy → the highest level directory, which does not have a parent directory.

An absolute path name of a file → uniquely identified by an internal ID, f, is the concatenation of the directory and file names leading from the root to the file f.

A relative path name → a concatenation of file names starting with the current directory.

A directed acyclic directory hierarchy → organizes directories such that any directory at a given level may point to zero or more files or other directories at lower levels but also permits any file or directory to have more than one parent directory.

A reference count → a non-negative integer associated with a file f, which indicates how many directories are pointing to the file.

A symbolic link (or shortcut) → a directory entry that points to a file or directory just like a regular entry but is treated differently with respect to deletion. A delete operation only removes the link but not the file itself.
