# Terms

A disk block → a fixed sequence of bytes on the disk, which can only be accessed as a single unit using low-level read-block and write-block operations.

In a contiguous block allocation scheme → every file is mapped into a contiguous sequence of disk blocks.

With a linked block allocation scheme → the blocks containing a file may be scattered throughout the disk.

A clustered block allocation scheme → links together sequences of contiguous blocks. The last block of any cluster points to the beginning of the logically next cluster.

A File allocation table (FAT) → an array where each entry corresponds to a disk block. The FAT keeps track of which disk blocks belong to a file by linking the blocks in a chain of indices.

With an indexed block allocation scheme → file blocks may reside anywhere on the disk. An index table is provided for each file, which keeps track of the blocks belonging to the file.

A bitmap → a data structure where each bit represents one disk block. A 1 indicates that the block is allocated and a 0 indicates that the block is free.
