The create file → operation causes the creation of new named file.

The destroy file → operation removes an existing file from the FS.

The open file table (OFT) → a data structure that keeps track of all files currently in use to facilitate efficient access to and manipulation of the files.

The open file → operation prepares a file for efficient access and manipulation by retrieving relevant file information from the FCB and storing the information in an entry of the OFT.

A read file → operation copies data from an open file to a specified area in main memory.

A write file → operation copies data from an area in main memory to a specified open file.

A seek → operation moves the current position of an open file to a new specified position.

The close file → operation reverses the effects of the open operation by saving the current state of the file in the FCB and freeing the OFT entry.
