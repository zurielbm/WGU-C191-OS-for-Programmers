# Terms

A buffer → a register or an area of main memory used to hold data generated by a producer process or an input device and removed from the buffer at a later time by a consumer process or an output device.

Buffer swapping → a technique that allows the operations of a producer process and a consumer process to overlap by using two buffers.

A circular buffer → a fixed array of buffer slots filled by the producer and emptied by the consumer one slot at a time in ascending order, modulo the buffer size.

A disk block cache → a set of main memory buffers that contain the most recently accessed disk blocks.
