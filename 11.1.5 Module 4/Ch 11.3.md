# Terms

A track → one of many concentric rings on a magnetic disk surface.

A sector → a portion of a track and is the smallest unit of data that can be read or written with a single r/w operation.

The seek time → the time to move the r/w head from the current position to the track containing the desired data.

The rotational delay (rotational latency) → the time to wait for the desired data item to pass under the r/w head.

The data transfer time → the time to transfer the desired number of bits to or from the disk, and is directly proportional to the disk's rotational speed.

Peak transfer rate → the rate at which the data is streamed to or from the disk once the read/write head is at the beginning of the sector to be transferred.

Sustained data rate → the rate at which the disk can transfer data continuously.

The Shortest seek time first (SSTF) → scheduling algorithm considers the list of all pending requests and always selects the request that requires the shortest travel distance from the current position.

The Scan scheduling algorithm → mimics the behavior of an elevator in a building. The r/w head maintains a current direction of travel and services all request sequentially in the current direction. When the outermost request is reached, the direction is reversed and the algorithm services all requests in the opposite direction.

The C-Scan scheduling algorithm → a variant of the Scan algorithm that services requests in only one direction. When the outermost request is reached, the r/w head sweeps back to the opposite end of the disk and starts servicing requests again in the same direction.
