The operating system (OS) → the software that runs on the bare hardware of a computer and provides essential support for users to develop and use applications in the most efficient and safe manner.

Abstraction → the act of removing unimportant details or attributes of objects in order to construct more general and less complex objects.

Virtualization → the act of creating the illusion of having one or more objects with more desirable characteristics than the real object.

Multiprogramming → a technique that keeps several programs active in memory and switches execution among the different programs to maximize the use of the CPU and other resources.

Time-sharing (multitasking) → an extension of multiprogramming where the CPU is switched periodically among all active computations to guarantee acceptable response times to each user.
