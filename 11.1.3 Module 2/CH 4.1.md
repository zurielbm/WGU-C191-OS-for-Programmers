Long-term scheduling → decides when a process should enter the ready state and start competing for the CPU.

Short-term scheduling → decides which of the ready processes should run next on the CPU.

A non-preemptive → scheduling algorithm allows a running process to continue until the process terminates or blocks on a resource.

A preemptive → scheduling algorithm may stop the currently running process and choose another process to run.

The priority of a process (or thread) → a numerical value that indicates the importance of the process relative to other processes.

The arbitration rule → decides which process should proceed if two or more processes have the same priority.
